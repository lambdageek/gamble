TODO: avoid instrumenting *safe* applications?
  - eg known first-order functions like list, +, etc
  - potential benefits: speed, code size, size of address reps

Issue: interop w/ Racket, etc
- solved issue with for/*, other macros
- HO functions still not ok
- Idea: develop mem-like context-replacement/augmentation discipline?
  eg, (lift map) = (lambda (f xs) (map (lift* f) xs))
      where (lift* f) = (lambda (x) (app/call-site (list 'map f x) f x)) ????
