@title[#:tag "solvers"]{Samplers and Solvers}

A @deftech{sampler} is a procedure that takes zero arguments, runs a
stochastic program, and produces a single result.

The examples in the following sections use the following function
definitions:

@interaction[#:eval the-eval
(define (count-heads n)
  (if (zero? n) 0 (+ (if (flip) 1 0) (count-heads (sub1 n)))))
(define (geom)
  (if (flip) 0 (add1 (geom))))
]

@defform[(rejection-sampler def/expr ... result-expr maybe-when-clause)
         #:grammar ([maybe-when-clause (code:line)
                                       (code:line #:when condition-expr)])]{

Produces a @tech{sampler} that, when applied, returns a value of
@racket[result-expr] arising from an execution where
@racket[condition-expr], if present, was satisfied.

The sampler is implemented using rejection sampling. That is, the
@racket[def/expr]s and @racket[result-expr] are evaluated. Then
@racket[condition-expr] is evaluated, if present; if it produces
@racket[#t], the execution is accepted and the value of
@racket[result-expr] is returned; otherwise, the process is repeated.

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(define s-or
  (rejection-sampler
    (define A (flip))
    (define B (flip))
    A
    #:when (or A B)))
(hist (repeat s-or 100))
(hist (repeat s-or 1000))

(define rs-count-heads
  (rejection-sampler
   (count-heads 10)))
(rs-count-heads)
(rs-count-heads)
(hist (repeat rs-count-heads 100))
]
}

@defform[(mh-sampler def/expr ... result-expr maybe-when-clause)
         #:grammar ([maybe-when-clause (code:line)
                                       (code:line #:when condition-expr)])]{

Like @racket[rejection-sampler], but when applied repeatedly uses a
variant of Metropolis-Hastings as described in @cite{Bher}.

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(define mh-or
  (mh-sampler
    (define A (flip))
    (define B (flip))
    A
    #:when (or A B)))
(hist (repeat mh-or 100))
(hist (repeat (lag mh-or 100) 100))

(define mh-n-flips
  (mh-sampler
   (count-heads 10)))
(parameterize ((verbose? #t))
  (mh-n-flips))
(parameterize ((verbose? #t))
  (mh-n-flips))
(hist (repeat mh-n-flips 100))
(hist (repeat (lag mh-n-flips 100) 100))
(hist (repeat mh-n-flips 2000))
]
}

@defform[(enumerate def/expr ... result-expr
           maybe-when-clause maybe-limit-clause maybe-normalize-clause)
         #:grammar ([maybe-when-clause (code:line)
                                       (code:line #:when condition-expr)]
                    [maybe-limit-clause (code:line)
                                        (code:line #:limit limit-expr)]
                    [maybe-normalize-clause (code:line)
                                            (code:line #:normalize? normalize?-expr)])]{

Returns a distribution table of the form @racket[(list (list _value
_prob) ...)], where @racket[_value] is a value produced by
@racket[result-expr] and @racket[_prob] is its normalized probability
given @racket[condition-expr]. If @racket[normalize?-expr] is given
and evaluates to @racket[#f], then the probability is unnormalized
instead.

The @racket[enumerate] form works by exploring all possibilities using
the technique described in @cite{EPP}. If @racket[limit-expr]
evaluates to a probability @racket[_limit], then exploration ceases
when the unexplored possibilities have probability less than
@racket[_limit] times the sum of the probabilities of the results
accepted by @racket[condition-expr] so far. If @racket[limit-expr]
evalues to @racket[#f], then exploration ceases only when all paths
have been explored; if any path is infinite, then @racket[enumerate]
fails to terminate.

Only discrete and integer-valued @tech{ERP}s can be used with
@racket[enumerate], and infinite-range ERPs (such as
@racket[geometric]) require the use of @racket[#:limit] to enforce
termination.

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(enumerate
  (define A (flip))
  (define B (flip))
  A
  #:when (or A B))
(enumerate
  (define A (geom))
  A
  #:when (< 10 A 20))
]

Use @racket[#:limit] to control when exploration should be cut
off. The default limit is @racket[1e-6].

@interaction[#:eval the-eval
(enumerate
  (geom)
  #:limit 1e-9)
]

Use @racket[#:normalize? #f] to get the result probabilities without
normalizing by the acceptance rate:

@interaction[#:eval the-eval
(enumerate
 (define (drop-coin?) (flip 0.9))
 (define (drunk-flips n)
   (cond [(zero? n)
          #t]
         [(drop-coin?)
          'failed]
         [else
          (and (flip) (drunk-flips (sub1 n)))]))
 (define A (drunk-flips 10))
 (eq? A #t)
 #:when (not (eq? A 'failed))
 #:normalize? #f
 (code:comment "Default limit is too high to detect #t case")
 #:limit #f)
]
}


@defform[(importance-sampler def/expr ... result-expr maybe-when-clause)
         #:grammar ([maybe-when-clause (code:line)
                                       (code:line #:when condition-expr)])]{

Like @racket[rejection-sampler], but uses the lazy-search tree
mechanism of @racket[enumerate], although without exhaustively
exploring it.

Produces a @emph{weighted sampler}.

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(define ws
  (importance-sampler
    (define A (flip))
    (define B (flip))
    A
    #:when (or A B)))
(repeat ws 10)
]
}
