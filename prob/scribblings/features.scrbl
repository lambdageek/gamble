@title[#:tag "features"]{Probabilistic Features}

The probabilistic features of this language consist of @tech[#:key
"erp"]{elementary random procedures (ERPs)}, a memoizer, and a set of
sampler/solvers.

At a high level, every ERP when called produces a value from an
associated probability distribution. The precise behavior of an ERP,
however, depends on the sampler/solver context it is executed
under. In a @racket[mh-sampler] context, for example, an ERP might
reuse a choice from a previous run, subject to random
perturbations. In an @racket[enumeration] context, an ERP will fork
its context and potentially the consequences of all values in its
distribution.

@section[#:tag "erps"]{Elementary Random Procedures}

An @deftech[#:key "erp"]{elementary random procedure (ERP)} returns a
value drawn from some distribution each time it is called.

@subsection[#:tag "discrete-erps"]{Discrete ERPs}

@defproc[(flip [p probability? 1/2])

element in @racket[vals] weighted by the corresponding element in
@racket[weights], if present.

            real?])]{

Returns a real drawn from @racket[(uniform-dist)],
@racket[(uniform-dist hi)], or @racket[(uniform-dist lo hi)],
respectively.
}


@section[#:tag "fail"]{Condition Failure}

@defproc[(fail [reason any/c #f]) any]{

Used to express condition failure. When used within a sampler or
solver, it typically causes the sampler/solver to try again with a
different set of choices.

For example, the following function models two coin flips where at
least one of them is known to be heads (@racket[#t]):

@racketblock[
(define (flip-two-coins/one-heads)
  (define A (flip))
  (define B (flip))
  (unless (or A B) (fail))
  (list A B))
]
}


@section[#:tag "table"]{Indexed Tables}

@defform*[[(table ([var-id sequence-expr] ...+) maybe-lazy body ...+)
           (table (var-id ...+) body ...+)]
          #:grammar ([maybe-lazy (code:line)
                                 (code:line #:lazy)])
          #:contracts ([sequence-expr sequence?])]{

Creates an indexed collection that acts like a function; the function
takes as many arguments as there are @racket[var-id]s.

In the first form, the table is finite, and it is eagerly populated
with an entry for every combination of elements from each
@racket[sequence-expr]. (Each @racket[sequence-expr] must be finite.)
If a finite table is addressed with indexes that
do not occur in @racket[sequence-expr], an error is raised.

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(define F (table ([i 10] [j 20]) (flip)))
(F 0 0)
(F 2 3)
(F 7 13)
]

If the @racket[#:lazy] keyword appears after the variable binding
sequence, then the table's entries are not evaluated until they are
looked up (see also @racket[pdelay]).

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(define LF (table ([i 10] [j 20]) #:lazy (printf "flipping!\n") (flip)))
(LF 0 0)
(LF 0 0)
]

In the second form, the table is conceptually infinite, and it is
lazily populated as entries are requested. This form is equivalent to
@racket[(mem (lambda (var-id ...) body ...))].
}


@section[#:tag "mem"]{Memoization}

@defproc[(mem [f procedure?])
         procedure?]{

Returns a memoized version of @racket[f].

In general, a memoized function must not be called outside of the
dynamic extent of the sampler/solver context in which it was
created. See @seclink["nesting"] for more discussion.

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(define f (mem (lambda (n) (bernoulli))))
(f 1)

(code:line (f 1) (code:comment "calling (f 1) again will get the same value"))
(for/list ([i 10]) (f i))
(for/list ([i 10]) (f i))
]
}
