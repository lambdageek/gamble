;; Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - System

;; An HMC system is a pair of:
;; - a DB of random choices, now thought of as the position X;
;; - a DB of synthetic random choices that are the momentum P of the system.
;;
;; Coherence:
;;   - Each address k that appears in P also appears in both X.
;;   - if there is some zone z such that X can be partitioned into
;;     disjoint Xz Xnz such that all entries in Xz are in z and none
;;     in Xnz are in z, then each address in P is in Xz and not in Xnz.
;;   - Corresponding entires x, p with the same address
;;       obey: (and (equal? (entry-pinned? x) (entry-pinned? p))
;;                  (equal? (entry-zones x) (entry-zones p)))

HMC - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

The usual database of random choices is now thought of as
the "position" of a particle and an auxiliary normally
distributed "momentum" random variable is added such that the
quantity:
  H(x,p) = U(x) + K(p)
is conserved.  Where U(x) is the "potential energy" of the position
and K(p) is the "kinetic energy" of the momentum.

Limitations:
1. All distributions in the database should be continous.

2. There should be no "structural" choices.  (ie, the values of random
choices do not affect control flow through the probabilistic program).
