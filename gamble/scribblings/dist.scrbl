@title[#:tag "dist"]{Probability Distributions}

This section describes the distribution types and operations supported
by @racketmodname[gamble].

@section[#:tag "dist-ops"]{Distribution Operations}

@defproc[(dist? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is a distribution object,
@racket[#f] otherwise.
}

@defproc[(integer-dist? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is a distribution object whose
support is intrinsically integer-valued, @racket[#f] otherwise.

The distribution types for which @racket[integer-dist?] returns true
consist of exactly the ones listed in @secref["integer-dists"]. A
discrete distribution whose values happen to be integers is not
considered an integer distribution.
}

@defproc[(finite-dist? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is a distribution object whose
support is finite, @racket[#f] otherwise.

The distribution types for which @racket[finite-dist?] returns true
consist of exactly the ones listed in @secref["integer-dists"] and
@secref["discrete-dist"].
}

@defproc[(real-dist? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is a distribution object whose
support is a real interval, @racket[#f] otherwise.

The distribution types for which @racket[real-dist?] returns true
consist of exactly the ones listed in @secref["real-dists"].  A
discrete distribution whose values happen to be real numbers is
@emph{not} considered a real distribution. A distribution whose values
consist of real vectors, such as a Dirichlet distribution, is
@emph{not} considered real-valued.
}

@defproc[(dist-pdf [d dist?] [v any/c] [log? any/c #f]) 
         real?]{

Returns the probability density (or mass, as appropriate) of the value
@racket[v] in distribution @racket[d]. If @racket[log?] is true, the
log density (or log mass) is returned instead.
}

@defproc[(dist-cdf [d dist?] [v any/c] [log? any/c #f] [1-p? any/c #f]) 
         real?]{

Returns the cumulative probability density (or mass, as appropriate)
of the value @racket[v] in distribution @racket[d]---that is, the
probability that a random variable @racket[_X] distributed as
@racket[d] satisfies @racket[(<= _X v)]. If @racket[1-p?] is true,
then the probability of @racket[(> _X v)] is returned instead.

If @racket[log?] is true, then the log probability is returned
instead of the probability.

This function applies only to integer-valued (@racket[integer-dist?])
and real-valued (@racket[real-dist?]) distributions.
}

@defproc[(dist-inv-cdf [d dist?] [p (real-in 0 1)] [log? any/c #f] [1-p? any/c #f])
         any/c]{

Returns the inverse of the CDF of @racket[d] at @racket[p]. If
@racket[log?] is true, then the inverse at @racket[(exp p)] is used
instead. If @racket[1-p?] is true, then the inverse at @racket[(- 1
p)] is used instead.
}

@defproc[(dist-sample [d dist?]) any/c]{

Produces a sample distributed according to @racket[d]. This is an
@emph{unmanaged} stochastic effect, like calling Racket's
@racket[random] function.

@emph{Do not use @racket[dist-sample] within a sampler/solver; use
@racket[sample] instead.}
}

}

@defproc[(in-dist [d finite-dist?]) sequence?]{

Returns a @tech[#:doc '(lib
"scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{sequence} where each element
consists of two values: a value from the support of the distribution
and its probability mass.

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(for ([(v p) (in-dist (bernoulli-dist 1/3))])

@defproc[(dist-median [d dist?])

@defproc[(dist-variance [d dist?])
         (or/c any/c +nan.0 #f)]
]]{

Returns the mean, median, or variance of the distribution @racket[d],
respectively.

If the distribution is integer-valued or real-valued, the statistic is
a real number. Other kinds of distribution may have other types for
these statistics.

A return value of @racket[+nan.0] indicates that the statistic is
known to be undefined.

A return value of @racket[#f] indicates that the statistic is unknown;
it may not be defined, it may be infinite, or the calculation might
not be implemented.
}

@defproc[(dist-modes [d dist?])
         (or/c list? #f)]{

Returns the modes of the distribution @racket[d].

A return value of @racket['()] indicates that the distribution has no
mode. A return value of @racket[#f] indicates that the statistic is
unknown; it may not be defined, it may be infinite, or the calculation
might not be implemented.
}

@defproc[(dist-energy [d dist?] [x any/c]) real?]{

Returns the value of the ``energy'' function of @racket[d] evaluated
at @racket[x]. Minimizing energy is equivalent to maximizing likelihood.

Equivalent to @racket[(- (log (dist-pdf d x)))].

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(define N (normal-dist 0 1))
(dist-energy N 5)
(dist-energy N 1)
(dist-energy N 0)
(dist-energy N -1)
]
}

@defproc[(dist-Denergy [d dist?] 
                       [x real?]
                       [dx/dt real? 1]
                       [dparam/dt real? 0] ...)
         real?]{

Returns the value at @racket[x] of the derivative of @racket[d]'s
energy function. 

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(define N (normal-dist 0 1))
(dist-Denergy N 5)
(dist-Denergy N 1)
(dist-Denergy N 0)
(dist-Denergy N -1)
]

The parameters of @racket[d] and the position @racket[x] are
considered functions of a hypothetical variable @racket[_t], and the
derivative is taken with respect to @racket[_t]. Thus by varying
@racket[dx/dt] and the @racket[dparam/dt]s, mixtures of the partial
derivatives of energy with respect to the distribution's parameters
can be recovered.

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(define N (normal-dist 0 1))
(code:line (dist-Denergy N 5 1 0 0) (code:comment "∂energy/∂x"))
(code:line (dist-Denergy N 5 0 1 0) (code:comment "∂energy/∂μ; μ is 1st param of normal-dist"))
(code:line (dist-Denergy N 5 0 0 1) (code:comment "∂energy/∂σ; σ is 2nd param of normal-dist"))
]

If the derivative is not defined (such as for non-continuous
distributions) or not implemented for distribution @racket[d], an
exception is raised.
}

@defproc[(dist-update-prior [prior dist?] [dist-pattern any/c] [data vector?])
         (or/c dist? #f)]{

Returns a distribution representing a closed-form solution to Bayes'
Law applied to a distribution matching @racket[dist-pattern] whose
parameter is distributed according to @racket[prior] and incorporating
@racket[data] as evidence. The result is a distribution of the same
type as @racket[prior]. If @racket[prior] is not a (known, implemented)
conjugate prior for @racket[dist-pattern], @racket[#f] is returned.

The @racket[dist-pattern] is an S-expression consisting of a
distribution type name (a symbol) and the distribution parameters,
where the parameter distributed according to @racket[prior] is
indicated by the symbol @racket['_].

For example, if the prior of a Bernoulli distribution's success
probability is @racket[(beta-dist 1 1)], and three successes are
observed, the posterior can be calculated with:
@interaction[#:eval the-eval
(dist-update-prior (beta-dist 1 1) '(bernoulli-dist _) (vector 1 1 1))
]
If one success and two failures were observed, the posterior is
@interaction[#:eval the-eval
(dist-update-prior (beta-dist 1 1) '(bernoulli-dist _) (vector 1 0 0))
]
Here is another example where the mean of a normal distribution is
also normally distributed, but the standard deviation is fixed.
@interaction[#:eval the-eval
(dist-update-prior (normal-dist 10 1) '(normal-dist _ 1) (vector 9))
(dist-update-prior (normal-dist 10 1) '(normal-dist _ 0.5) (vector 9))

@section[#:tag "discrete-dist"]{Discrete Distribution Type}

A discrete distribution is a distribution whose support is a finite
collection of arbitrary Racket values. Note: this library calls
@racket[categorical-dist] a distribution whose support consists of the
integers {0, 1, ..., @italic{N}}.

The elements of a discrete distribution are distinguished using
@racket[equal?]. The constructors for discrete distributions detect
and coalesce duplicates.

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is a discrete distribution,

Defines @racket[dist-name] as a new distribution type. In particular,
@racket[dist-name] is a struct implementing the internal generic
interface representing distributions.

At a minimum, the new distribution type must supply a probability
density/mass function (@racket[pdf-fun]) and a sampling function
(@racket[sample-fun]). The type may also supply a cumulative
probability function (@racket[cdf-fun]) and inverse
(@racket[inv-cdf-fun]). The signatures of the functions are like
@racket[dist-pdf], @racket[dist-sample], etc, but instead of the
distribution itself, they accept the fields of the distribution as the
initial arguments.

The @racket[guard-fun] is a struct guard function; see
@racket[make-struct-type] for details. Other struct options may be
passed via the @racket[#:extra] option. Distribution types are
automatically transparent.

By default, @racket[dist-name], @racket[_dist-name?], and the
synthesized accessors are provided with the @racket[field-ctc]
contracts. The @racket[#:no-provide] option disables automatic
providing, in which case the @racket[field-ctc]s are ignored.
