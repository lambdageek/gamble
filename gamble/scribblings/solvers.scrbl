@title[#:tag "solvers"]{Samplers and Solvers}

The point of writing a generate model is typically not to simply run
it to generate data, but rather to do @emph{inference} on it---for
example, to estimate parameters given observed data. This requires
wrapping the model in a @tech{sampler} or @tech{solver} of some sort.

A @deftech{sampler} is an object that contains a probabilistic program
and produces samples from the posterior distribution of its result
expression. Samplers can be either unweighted (where each sample is
equally representative of the posterior distribution) or
@deftech[#:key "weighted sampler"]{weighted} (where each sample comes
with a factor that corrects for the ratio of its sampling frequency
and its probability in the posterior distribution).

The following samplers are supported:
@itemlist[
@item{@racket[rejection-sampler] --- unweighted sampler, does not
support observations on continuous random variables}
@item{@racket[importance-sampler] --- weighted sampler}
@item{@racket[enum-importance-sampler] --- weighted sampler}
@item{@racket[mh-sampler] --- unweighted sampler, uses MCMC to seek
high-probability zones}
]

Aside from @tech{samplers}, there are other @deftech{solvers} that can
extract information from a probabilistic model. The following solvers
are supported:
@itemlist[
@item{@racket[enumerate] --- exhaustive enumeration (up to optional
threshold), exponential in number of random variables, cannot handle
sampling from continuous random variables}
]

The examples in the following sections use the following function
definitions:

@interaction[#:eval the-eval
(define (count-heads n)
  (if (zero? n) 0 (+ (if (flip) 1 0) (count-heads (sub1 n)))))
(define (geom)
  (if (flip) 0 (add1 (geom))))

The samplers supported by this language consist of simple samplers and
a more complicated and flexible

Produces a @tech{sampler} that, when applied, returns a value of
@racket[result-expr] arising from an execution where
@racket[condition-expr], if present, was satisfied.

The sampler is implemented using rejection sampling---specifically,
``logic sampling''---for discrete random choices. That is, the
@racket[def/expr]s and @racket[result-expr] are evaluated. Then
@racket[condition-expr] is evaluated, if present; if it produces
@racket[#t], the execution is accepted and the value of
@racket[result-expr] is returned; otherwise, the process is repeated.

The rejection sampler can sample continuous random variables, but it
cannot perform observations (@racket[observe-sample]) on them.

Like @racket[rejection-sampler], but returns a @emph{weighted sampler}

sampler, an importance sampler can handle observations
(@racket[observe-sample]) on continuous random variables.

@section[#:tag "mh-sampler"]{Metropolis-Hastings Sampler and Transitions}

Metropolis-Hastings (MH) is an algorithm framework for producing a
correlated sequence of samples where each sample is based on the
previous. The algorithm is parameterized by the mechanism for
proposing a new state given the previous state; given a proposal, the
MH algorithm accepts or rejects it based on how the proposal was
generated and the relative likelihood of the proposed state.

The @racket[mh-sampler] form implements the Metropolis-Hastings
framework, and the proposal mechanisms are implemented by a variety of
@deftech{MH transition} types.

A @deftech{zone pattern} matches a zone if the two values are

If the set of observations in the probabilistic program is always the

observations and the observed values stay the same), then it is safe
to set @racket[record-obs?] to @racket[#f] to avoid creating database
entries for observations. This can improve the efficiency of typical
programs. If the observation set changes from run to run, however,

@subsection[#:tag "hmc-utils"]{Specifying Derivatives for HMC}

The @racket[hmc] transition requires that all the distributions in the
model are continuous.  It further requires partial derivatives for
each parameter of the distribution of each random variable in terms of
any previous random variable. Such information is provided using the
@racket[derivative] special form.

@defform[(derivative sampling-expr parameter-derivative-clause ...)
         #:grammar ([parameter-derivative-clause
                     (code:line [(label-ids ...) partial-fn-expr])
                     (code:line #f)])]{

Annotates the @racket[sampling-expr] expression with the partial
derivatives of its parameters.

The @racket[sampling-expr] should be either a call to @racket[sample]
or a use of one of the functions from @secref["erps"].

There should be as many parameter derivative clauses as there are
parameters of the underlying distribution. Each
@racket[parameter-derivative-clause] consists of a sequence of labels
of the random variables that the parameter depends on together with a
function that produces the partial derivative of that parameter value
with respect to the listed random variables, given the values of those
random variables. The clause @racket[[() (lambda () (values))]], which
indicates that the parameter is independent of all previous random
variables, can be abbreviated as @racket[#f].

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(define derivative-example
  (hmc-sampler
   (define A (label 'A-lbl (derivative (normal 0 1) #f #f)))
   (define B (label 'B-lbl (derivative (normal 1 1) #f #f)))

   (define C (derivative (normal (- (* A A) (* B B)) 1)
                         [(A-lbl B-lbl)
                          (λ (a b)

                         #f))
   B))
]

In the example above, @racket[A] and @racket[B] do not depend on any
other random variables, so the derivatives of their parameters are
zero (shorthand: @racket[#f]). The mean (first parameter) of
@racket[C], on the other hand, depends on both @racket[A] and
@racket[B], so its derivative clause lists their labels, and the
function returns two values: the partial derivative of @racket[(- (* A
A) (* B B))] with respect to @racket[A] and @racket[B], in that order.

The @racket[enumerate] form works by exploring all possibilities using

ceases when the error of the normalized result distribution would be
less than @racket[_limit]---that is, when the unexplored paths have
probability less than @racket[_limit] times the sum of the
probabilities of the paths accepted so far.

Only discrete and integer-valued distributions can be sampled with
@racket[enumerate], and infinite-range distributions (such as
@racket[geometric-dist]) and infinitely-deep recursive functions (such
